            <p>I grew up in Minnesota. Surrounded by large, verdant forests and many glimmering lakes. A lot of my time in Minnesota was spent outdoors. Memories of nature walks, the State Fair, the Mall of America, and an amusement park known as Valleyfair are  something I cherish.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I moved to Illinois in 2016, about a month after I graduated high school. </p>

            <img id="gamegear" src="images/gaming.jpg" alt="Gaming">
            <p>Video games were a massive part of my childhood growing up. Growing up with the classic Nintendo 64 and Gameboy my dad bought for me from a pawn shop, I spent countless hours playing various titles such as Mario Kart and Pok√©mon. Eventually I moved up to the Xbox 360, playing games like Halo, Forza Motorsport, the Batman Arkham series, and countless others.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Eventually I moved on to Playstation and PC as well. Being able to dive into an immersive story and the feeling of experiencing it the first time were hallmarks of my time growing up.</p>

            <p>Since 2014 I've actually been uploading to a Youtube channel under the name of MistahMerc. When I was younger I really wanted to be like the youtubers I watched on the website, making videos on games that I loved. I don't upload much anymore but I do sporadically find something to put up there. I, at one point, dabbled in music. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9M5fdv8HQQ">The Missing Serenade</a> being a favorite creation of mine.</p>

            <h3>AI Art</h3>
            <p>Recently I picked up a new hobby, AI generated art. Essentially, you give an AI a prompt and it makes artwork based off what was provided. There's a lot of trial and error involved with it, but below are a few of the creations I came up with.</p>
